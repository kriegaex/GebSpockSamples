## JNI

This module's source code relates to Baeldung articles about the Java Native Interface (JNI).
It was taken from [this project](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/tree/d2a788dcf78e98d0bd19031a6ae03453c1141810/java-native). The original JUnit tests were deleted and replaced by one example Spock test.
